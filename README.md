# Character_Select
Creating character select for Guilty Gear Strive
I tried to make something similar before with mutliple pages but I was not
able to make the user's decsions transfer to the final page. So I will try it on one page.

<br>
<h1>Goals</h1>
  -[x] Structure page so that user can pick character and opponent.<br>
  -[x] Let user's decesion transfer to the results section of page.<br>
  -[x] Give user results based on choices.<br>
